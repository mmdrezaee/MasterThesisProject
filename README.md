# MasterThesisProject
This project was developed using Unity for the client and Golang for the server. We employed the Q-box 20 in our project. The client is capable of working as a real-time platform or an offline platform.

The main purpose of this research is to identify blind spots in various crane target scenarios and provide a platform for enhanced vision, including additional cameras in different locations to achieve greater visibility and control over tower cranes.



## [server repo](https://github.com/amkkashani/VR_Buildings_server/tree/master):

The server side was developed using Golang. The server side was dockerized and could easily be deployed using the internal Docker compose setup. The server logged all data about the position and removed other types of data, such as first-handshaking logs and so on.
